# 1. Installation

## Requirements

* Magento 2.4.0 CE (the `$escaper` variable needs to be declared in templates)
* PHP >= 7.4
* Access to the Hyvä repository


## Getting Started

The module can be installed via composer by adding the repository as a source and then requiring it:

```
composer config repositories.hyva-themes/module-magento2-admin git git@gitlab.hyva.io:hyva-themes/magento2-hyva-admin.git
composer require hyva-themes/module-magento2-admin --prefer-source
```


If you want to just play around to get a feel for Hyva_Admin grids, you can install a test module that declares an example grid, too:

```
# make sure to config repositories.hyva-themes/module-magento2-admin first (see above)
composer config repositories.hyva-themes/module-magento2-admin-test git git@gitlab.hyva.io:hyva-themes/hyva-admin-test-module.git
composer require hyva-themes/module-magento2-admin-test --prefer-source
```

If you want to use the module with PHP 7.3, you can install the php73 branch instead:

```
composer require hyva-themes/module-magento2-admin:dev-php73 --prefer-source
```
(The branch contents are automatically backported thanks to rector).

## Stability

The module isn’t feature complete or stable. It’s currently in a state comparable to a closed beta.

The API will remain stable, unless some real flaw is discovered.

New features will be added in a backward compatible manner.
