# 12. Exports

Exports allow admin users to export the current selection of the grid.

Filters and sort orders are applied when exporting a grid.

Three export types are supported out of the box, and it also is possible to create custom export formats.

#### Supported Export Formats:

* CSV
* XML
* XLSX


```markup
<navigation>
    <exports>
        <export type="csv" label="Export as CSV"/>
        <export type="xml" label="Export as XML" enabled="false"/>
        <export type="xlsx" label="Export as XLSX"/>
        <export type="custom"
                label="Export as my custom format"
                class="\My\Module\Model\CustomGridExport"
                fileName="example.foo"
                sortOrder="1"
        />
    </exports>
</navigation>
```


For the known export types `csv`, `xml` and `xlsx` no class declaration is necessary.

For custom types an export class needs to be specified. The custom export class has to extend from 

`\Hyva\Admin\Model\GridExport\Type\AbstractExportType`.and implement the method 

`public function createFileToDownload()`. The CSV export class 

`\Hyva\Admin\Model\GridExport\Type\Csv` can serve as a good reference.
