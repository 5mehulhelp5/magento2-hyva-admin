# TODO

This is a short list of todos early during the development.
Later, when the module stabilizes, this file can be deleted and todo's can be maintained as issues or tickets.

## Next steps:

* test mass action and row action id parameter passing
* test grid without default sort column doesn't have surprising behavior
* add ui element to remove all filter values
* test boolean data type when rendering grid
* collection source type
* ajax paging
* fix LIKE wildcard character escaping in
  \Hyva\Admin\Model\GridFilter\TextFilter::apply
* caching the merge result in the grid config reader
* query source type
* inline grid editing
* form page support
