# TODO

This is a short list of todos early during the development.
Later, when the module stabilizes, this file can be deleted and todo's can be maintained as issues or tickets.

## Next steps:

* Allow selection of mass action records over more than one page
* ajax paging
* fix LIKE wildcard character escaping in
  \Hyva\Admin\Model\GridFilter\TextFilter::apply
* profile code and address bottlenecks as needed
* caching the merge result in the grid config reader
* query source type
* inline grid editing
* Clean up \Hyva\Admin\Model\TypeReflection\NamespaceMap::readUntilCassDefiniton
